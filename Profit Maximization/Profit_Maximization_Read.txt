You have to travel to different villages to make some profit.
In each village, you gain some profit. But the catch is, from
 a particular village i, you can only move to a village j if 
and only if i<j and the profit gain from village j is a multiple 
of the profit gain from village i.
You have to tell the maximum profit you can gain while traveling.
Input format:-

The first line contains a single integer N denoting the total number of villages.
The second line contains N space-separated integers, each denoting the profit gain  from village i.
Output format:-

Print the maximum profit you can gain.
